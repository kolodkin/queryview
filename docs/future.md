Planned work, highest priority first. Each entry is a proposal, not yet
implemented — the spec lives here until it ships, then moves into the relevant
doc.

## DuckDB file mode: schema picker

A DuckDB connection whose `path` is a `.duckdb` file should navigate like
Postgres: the picker lists the file's schemas (`duckdb_schemas()`, `main`
first, internal ones hidden) as the "databases", and the explorer lists the
tables and views of the picked schema with the estimates the driver already
computes. Same driver and same picker as folder mode (see
[explorer.md](./explorer.md)); the `path` decides the mode. Today file mode has
no picker and lists only what `SHOW TABLES` returns.
